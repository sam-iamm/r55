# R55 Configuration File
# This file configures the R55 compiler behavior, similar to Foundry's foundry.toml

# Source directories where contracts are located
# Default: ["src", "contracts"]
src = ["src", "contracts", "examples"]

# Output directory for compiled bytecode
# Default: "out"
out = "r55-output-bytecode"

# Library/dependency directories
# Default: ["lib"]
libs = ["lib", "dependencies"]

# Test contract directories (for future use)
# Default: ["test"]
test = ["test"]

# Script directories (for future use)
# Default: ["script"]
script = ["script"]

# Path remappings for imports
# Format: "alias=path"
# Example: "@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/"
remappings = [
    "@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/",
    "@chainlink/=lib/chainlink/",
    "@uniswap/=lib/uniswap/"
]

# Glob patterns to exclude from compilation
# Useful for excluding test files or specific contracts
exclude = [
    "**/test/**",
    "**/mock/**",
    "**/*.t.sol"
]

# Profile-specific configurations (similar to Foundry)
# You can define different profiles for different environments
[profile.default]
# Default profile settings (inherited by all profiles)

[profile.production]
# Production-specific settings
# Could include optimization flags in the future

[profile.development]
# Development-specific settings
# Could include debug flags in the future
